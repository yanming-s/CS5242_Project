    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical image classification has become a critical application of deep learning, particularly in diagnosing diseases from radiological scans. The NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, a widely used benchmark for thoracic disease classification, presents challenges due to its multi-label nature, imbalanced class distribution, and noisy annotations. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated strong feature extraction capabilities for classification tasks. Besides, generative models show promising ability to detect the abnormal. Our project aims to explore the effectiveness of CNNs, Transformers, and generative models in classifying abnormalities in the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset."

    "\n",
    "Project plan outlines a very good baseline for the different steps in the deep learning pipeline, and also shows additional initiatives regarding the generative model. However, the project does not seem to consider the specific challenges of the application of AI in healthcare:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dealing with limited labelled data. Could explore generative models to obtain more data, or self-supervised learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dealing with domain shift (Non-IID). The data generated from the different hospitals creates variations in the data distribution, which the model should be invariant to.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explainability. This is very important for the application of AI in healthcare since we want to know what the model made a certain prediction. In the dataset, some images also contain the bounding boxes, which could be used to explore localization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluation metric. Since false negatives are significantly more expensive than false positives, the training of the model should take this into account. This is also exacerbated by the imbalanced class problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides implementing the baseline steps in the deep learning pipeline, do consider more advanced and problem-specific techniques/problems to tackle.\n"
